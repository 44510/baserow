| SYNC\_TEMPLATES\_ON\_STARTUP                      | If set to “true” when the Baserow backend service starts up it will automaticly sync all builtin Baserow templates. If you are using a postgres database which is constrained to fewer than 10000 rows then we recommend you disable this as the Baserow templates will go over that row limit. To disable this set to any other value than “true”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                         | true                                                                 | true                                                                           | true                                | false                                    | true                                                                           |

| DONT\_UPDATE\_FORMULAS\_AFTER\_MIGRATION          | Baserow’s formulas have an internal version number. When upgrading Baserow if the formula language has also changed then after the database migration has run Baserow will also automatically recalculate all formulas if they have a different version. Set this to any non empty value to disable this automatic update if you would prefer to run the update\_formulas management command manually yourself. Formulas might break if you forget to do so after an upgrade of Baserow until and so it is recommended to leave this empty.                                                                                                                                            |                                                         |                                                                      |                                                                                |                                     |                                          |                                                                                |
